# The loving mom
*Auteur: Klaas Mouws*

Once upon a time, there was a middle-aged woman named Amy who had been married for many years to her loving husband. Even though they had been together for so long, they still enjoyed spending time together and doing fun activities.

One day, Amy decided to try something new and went to a yoga class at the local gym. She was a little nervous at first, but as soon as she started the class she felt right at home. She enjoyed the challenge of the poses, the relaxation of the sessions, and the sense of community among her fellow yogis.

As time went on, Amy noticed that the same group of people kept showing up to the class. She started to recognize a few of them, and eventually, some of them became friends. One particular woman, named Karen, quickly became one of her closest friends.

Karen was a few years older than Amy and had two kids, a daughter and a son. Whenever Amy and Karen hung out, they always had a good time. They talked about life, exchanged stories, and even laughed about their age difference.

After a few months of regularly attending the same yoga class, Amy realized that she was attracted to Karen. She was scared to admit it to herself
